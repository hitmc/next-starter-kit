This project was built with the help of **[nextjs](https://nextjs.org)** and it uses a framework built by our friends from **[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/?ref=creativetim)**, who did an amazing job creating the backbone for the material effects, animations, ripples and transitions. Big thanks to this team for the effort and forward thinking they put into it.

Thanks to Creative Tim Team for the awesome starter theme at **[Creative Tim](https://creative-tim.com/)** Always check their repo for the updated codes. It's better to download and fork the actual repo for future development.

Thank you for visiting.
